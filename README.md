# amphour-get

`$ ./ahget.pl episode_number [another_episode_number [...]]`

Fetches episodes of the [Amp Hour](http://theamphour.com) podcast by [Dave Jones](http://eevblog.com) and [Chris Gammel](http://chrisgammel.com) from Libsyn.

Requires `wget` and `curl`. Works happily on Linux-ish systems. (Although Windows and Mac *should* be ok too, I just haven't tested it.)
